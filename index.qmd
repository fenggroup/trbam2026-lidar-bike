## Bicycling safety issues {data-menu-title="Background" }

- Bicycling is underutilized in the U.S. with 0.4% of commuters using bicycles.
- In 2023, 1166 bicyclists were killed and over 46,000 injured in the U.S.
- Traditional safety studies used manual or low-resolution methods, offering limited insight into how overtaking unfolds and motivating the need for advanced sensing technologies.

## Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) {}

- Lidar is a laser-based sensing technology that captures detailed 3D representations of surroundings.
- Lidar enables detailed 3D analysis of vehicle overtaking behavior, capturing precise distances and trajectories that traditional methods miss.
- This study leverages lidar to bridge the gap between technological innovation and safer bicycling environments.

## Objectives {}

- Collecting real-word data using cameras and lidar.
- Develop an offline algorithm to automatically detect and track overtaking vehicles based on the point clouds from a bicycle-mounted lidar.
- Develop surrogate safety measures for bicycling safety that can be automatically and objectively measured.

## Surrogate safety measures {}

- **Passing distance**: the closest distance from the lidar to the car within the passing region
- **Passing duration**: the duration of time that a vehicle spends in the bicycle's passing region
- **Vehicle Speed**: estimated based on 
  - **bicycle speed** estimated using frame-to-frame registration with ICP & RANSAC algorithms
  - **relative vehicle speed** estimated using numerical differentiation of vehicle centroid locations across frames  

## Results {}

- 306 overtaking events from two trips
- Passing distance validation over a sample of 98 events
  - MAE: 3.9 cm 
  - MAPE: 2.5%

## Discussions {}

- Lane geometry strongly influenced clearance: left-lane ≈ 4.47 m, right-lane ≈ 1.86 m.
- Close passes (<1.5 m) occurred at both low and high speeds, showing risk is not speed-dependent.
- Passing duration revealed exposure over time; longer overtakes often due to congestion or intersections.
- Safe overtaking depends on geometry + speed + traffic context, not any single factor.

## Future work {}

- Expand data collection across more routes, roadway types, and traffic conditions to improve generalizability.
- Refine methodology with stronger ground-filtering and segmentation to improve vehicle detection reliability.
- Analyze vehicle trajectories to better characterize lateral overtaking behavior across diverse environments.
